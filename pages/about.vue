      This is a <b>solid path</b> for those of you who want
      to complete a <strong>Computer Science</strong> course on your own time, for free, with courses from the <strong>best
      universities</strong> in the World. In our curriculum, we gave preference to MOOC (Massive Open Online Course)
      style courses because those courses were created with our style of learning in mind.
    </p>

    <h2>Motivation &amp; Preparation</h2>

    <p>Here are two interesting links that can make <b><b>all</b></b> the difference in your journey.</p>

    <p>
      The first one is a motivational video that shows a guy that went through the "MIT Challenge", that consists in
      learning the entire <b>4-year</b> MIT curriculum for Computer Science in <b>1 year</b>.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/mit-challenge-2/">MIT Challenge</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The second link is a MOOC that will teach you learning techniques used by experts in art, music, literature,
      math, science, sports, and many other disciplines. These are <b>fundamental abilities</b> to succeed in our
      journey.

    <h2>How to use our site</h2>

    <h3>Order of the classes</h3>

    <p>
      Our curriculum was developed to be consumed in a linear approach. What does this mean? That you should complete
      one course at a time.
    </p>

    <p>
      The courses are already in the order that you should complete them. Just start in the <strong>Introduction to
      Computer Science</strong> section and after finishing the first course, start the next one.
    </p>

    <p><b>If the course isn't open, do it anyway with the resources from the previous class.</b></p>

    <h3>Should I take all courses?</h3>

    <p><b>Yes</b>! The intention is to conclude <b>all</b> the courses listed here!</p>

    <h3>Duration of the project</h3>

    <p>
      It may take longer to complete all of the classes compared to a regular CS course, but I can <b>guarantee</b> you
      that your <b>reward</b> will be proportional to <b>your motivation/dedication</b>!
    </p>

    <p>
      You must focus on your <b>habit</b>, and <b>forget</b> about goals. Try to invest 1 ~ 2 hours <b>every day</b>
      studying this curriculum. If you do this, <b>inevitably</b> you'll finish this curriculum.
    </p>

      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>Project Based</h3>

    <p>
      Here in <strong>OSS University</strong>, you do not need to take exams, because we are focused on <strong>real
      projects</strong>!
    </p>

    <p>
      In order to show for everyone that you <b>successfully</b> finished a course, you should create a <strong>real
      project</strong>.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>«What does it mean?»
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      After finish a course, you should think about a <b>real world problem</b> that you can solve using the acquired
      knowledge in the course. You don't need to create a big project, but you must create something to <b>validate</b>
      and <b>consolidate</b> your knowledge, and also to show to the world that you are capable to create something
      useful with the concepts that you learned.
    </p>

    <p>
      The projects of all students will be listed on their public pages. Submit your project's repository to your
      personal profile after you conclude it.
    </p>

    <p><b>You can create this project alone or with other students!</b></p>

    <h3>Be creative!</h3>

    <p>This is a <b>crucial</b> part of your journey through all those courses.</p>

    <p>
      You <b>need</b> to have in mind that what you are able to <b>create</b> with the concepts that you learned will
      be your certificate and <b>this is what really matters</b>!
    </p>
    <p>In order to show that you <b>really</b> learned those things, you need to be <b>creative</b>!</p>

    <p>Here are some tips about how you can do that:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><b>Articles</b>: create blog posts to synthesize/summarize what you learned.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>GitHub repository</b>: keep your course's files organized in a GH repository, so in that way other
          students can use it to study with your annotations.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Cooperative work</h3>

    <p>
      <b>We love cooperative work</b>! Use our <a
      href="https://github.com/open-source-society/computer-science/blob/master/README.md#community">channels</a> to
      communicate with other fellows to combine and create new projects!
    </p>

    <h3>Which programming languages should I use?</h3>

    <p>
      My friend, here is the best part of liberty! You can use <b>any</b> language that you want to complete the
      courses.
    </p>

    <p>
      The important thing for each course is to <b>internalize</b> the <b>core concepts</b> and to be able to use them
      with whatever tool (programming language) that you wish.
    </p>

    <h3>Content Policy</h3>

    <p>
      You must share <b>only</b> files that you are <b>allowed</b> to! <b>Do NOT disrespect the code of conduct</b>
      that you signed in the beginning of some courses.
    </p>
