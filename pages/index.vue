      <h1>OSS</h1>
      <h2>University</h2>
      <p>Path to a free self-taught education in Computer Science!</p>

      <p>
        The OSSU curriculum is a <strong>complete education in computer science</strong> using online materials.
        It's not merely for career training or professional development.
        It's for those who want a proper, <em>well-rounded</em> grounding in concepts fundamental to all computing
        disciplines,
        and for those who have the discipline, will, and (most importantly!) good habits to obtain this education
        largely on their own,
        but with support from a worldwide community of fellow learners.
